# ML-Concepts-Playground  
Hands-On Implementation of Core Machine Learning Concepts Inspired by CodeBasics

## Overview  
This project contains a curated collection of mini machine learning projects implemented in Jupyter notebooks. Each folder focuses on a key ML concept or algorithm, with code examples and brief explanations. All concepts were explored while learning from the CodeBasics YouTube channel.

## Objectives  
- Reinforce foundational ML concepts through hands-on coding.
- Understand supervised and unsupervised algorithms with practical datasets.
- Apply model evaluation techniques and hyperparameter tuning.
- Develop intuition for preprocessing, regularization, and dimensionality reduction.

## Methodology  
- **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**:
  - One-Hot Encoding
  - L1 and L2 Regularization
  - Gradient Descent Optimization
- **Supervised Learning Algorithms**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Multivariate Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Naive Bayes
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Multiclass Classification
- **Model Evaluation & Tuning**:
  - K-Fold Cross Validation
  - Hyperparameter Tuning
  - Bagging for ensemble learning
- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Results  
- Developed a strong conceptual understanding of 15+ ML topics.
- Implemented all models from scratch or using `scikit-learn`.
- Visualized outputs and performance metrics using real-world examples.

## Tools & Libraries  
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- numpy, pandas  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

## Applications  
- Builds a solid foundation for real-world ML applications  
- Serves as a quick reference or starter kit for ML projects  
- Useful for academic learning, interviews, and portfolio building
